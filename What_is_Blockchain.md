What is Blockchain?

Blockchain is a distributed immutable ledger, which is completely transparent.


immutable --> means --> which we cannot change/modify.

ledger --> means --> Place where all transactions are stored.


When a transaction is done using the blockchain technology, then all the data regarding the transaction get stored in a block which is mined by a miner in the network connected to all the nodes through blockchain.

It is immutable because we cannot change the data once noted in the block.

Distributed --> because, When a new block of transaction is mined in a PC then after sometime that new block is added in the chain and shows up in all the PCs/Nodes connected across the network through blockchain.
Any change/modification done by a node in the network results in the generation of block,& will show up in all the devices connected across the network through the blockchain.
